#  5 States Where Sports Betting is Now Legal 

Since the Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May, 2018, more states have legalized sports betting. PASPA was a 1992 law that effectively made sports betting illegal except in Nevada. The overturning of this law has allowed states to pass their own legislation on the matter.

According to ESPN, as of September 3, 2018, there are now five states where sports betting is legal: Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, and West Virginia. In addition, Pennsylvania is expected to legalize sports betting soon.

Here is a look at how each state is implementing sports betting: 

Nevada was the first state to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court’s ruling. The Nevada Gaming Control Board released regulations for wagering on July 9th and began accepting bets on August 6th. 

Delaware was the second state to legalize sports betting and was the first to offer full-scale sports betting. Delaware’s three racetracks started taking bets on August 15th. 

New Jersey was the third state to legalize sports betting and also had the most expansive rollout. New Jersey’s Monmouth Park Racetrack started taking bets on August 14th, while Atlantic City’s Borgata Casino started taking bets on August 22nd. 

Mississippi was the fourth state to legalize sports betting and launched its industry with a bang. Mississippi’s Gulf Coast casinos started taking bets on August 23rd and reported over $3 million in wagers in the first two days alone. 

West Virginia became the fifth state to legalize sports betting and launched its industry on September 1st. West Virginia accepted its first bet at Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack & Resort in Chesterfield County.

#  Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey Lead the Way in Sports Betting Laws 

States are legalizing sports betting following the repeal of PASPA. The three states leading the way are Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey. 

In Nevada, any type of sports gambling has been legal since 1931. This includes betting on individual games, proposition bets (wagers on specific aspects of a game), and parlay betting (a series of two or more bets that are linked together). 

Delaware is a bit newer to the scene, legalizing sports betting in 2009. The state allows wagers on NFL games,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) other professional sports, college sports, and horses races. 

New Jersey was the fourth state to legalize sports betting following the repeal of PASPA. Sports betting there is available at racetracks and casinos, with both in-person and online bets accepted. Specific regulations vary depending on the casino or racetrack. For example, Monmouth Park Racetrack offers in-person betting only, while DraftKings offers both in-person and online betting.

#  Pennsylvania Joins the Ranks as a Legal Sports Betting State 

On October 30, 2018, the governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf, signed into law a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The new law went into effect on November 1.

This makes Pennsylvania the fourth state in the US to offer legal sports betting, after Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. West Virginia also passed a sports betting law this year, but it has not gone into effect yet.

Pennsylvania gaming officials say they expect sports betting to be up and running in the state by the start of the NFL playoffs in January 2019.

The new law allows casinos and racetracks in Pennsylvania to offer sports betting. Bettors will be able to place bets on professional and collegiate sporting events.

There is some speculation that the new law could benefit the Philadelphia Eagles, who are based in Pennsylvania and are current Super Bowl champions. State officials say they do not expect any preferential treatment for the Eagles, but some bettors may choose to place their bets with casinos and racetracks in the state rather than with out-of-state operators.

Opposition to the new law came from both sides of the political spectrum. Some conservatives argued that it would lead to increased gambling addiction rates, while some liberals argued that it would not go far enough in legalizing sports betting.

Governor Tom Wolf is a Democrat, and he said that he supported the measure because it would generate revenue for the state government. He also said that it would create jobs in the casino and racing industries.

Under the new law, casinos and racetracks will pay a 35% tax on gross revenues from sports betting. The first $10 million of those revenues will be used to fund programs that help problem gamblers recover from addiction.

#  Connecticut to Pass Legislation Allowing Sports Betting in the Near Future  5. Major League Baseball Backs Legalized Sports Betting

1. What Does This Mean for Connecticut? 


On Monday, May 14th, 2018, the Connecticut State Legislature approved a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The bill now moves to Governor Dannel Malloy's desk for his signature. If signed into law, Connecticut would become the fifth state in the country to allow sports betting, following in the footsteps of Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League have all voiced their support for legalized sports betting in recent months, with only the NFL remaining on the fence. So what does this mean for Connecticut?

Legalized sports betting would bring much-needed revenue to the state government. According to estimates from a 2016 report by Econsult Solutions, legalizing sports betting could generate between $9 million and $17 million in annual revenue for Connecticut. This money could be used to help bridge the state's budget deficit or fund important programs and services. In addition, legalized sports betting would create jobs and spur economic growth throughout the state. Restaurants, bars, and other businesses that offer gambling services would hire new employees, and people across Connecticut would spend their money at local businesses.

Legalized sports betting would also provide an important new source of entertainment for residents of Connecticut. People who enjoy watching sporting events would now have a chance to place bets on those events and make them even more exciting. In addition, legalized sports betting would give people a chance to make some extra money by correctly predicting the outcome of games.

Despite all of these benefits, there are some potential risks associated with legalized sports betting. There is always a risk that people will become addicted to gambling or that they will squander their hard-earned money on bets instead of using it for more responsible purposes. In addition, there is a danger that organized crime groups will infiltrate the legal gambling market and use it to launder money or commit other crimes. These risks must be taken into account before any decision is made about whether or not to legalize sports betting.

In conclusion, there are many reasons to support legalized sports betting in Connecticut. It would bring much-needed revenue to the state government, create jobs and spur economic growth throughout the state, and provide residents with an enjoyable new form of entertainment. However, there are also some potential risks associated with legalized sports betting which must be taken into account before any final decision is made.
