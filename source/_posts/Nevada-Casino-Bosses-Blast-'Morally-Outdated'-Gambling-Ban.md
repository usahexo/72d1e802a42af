#  Nevada Casino Bosses Blast 'Morally Outdated' Gambling Ban

LAS VEGAS - Top casino executives blasted a proposed federal ban on gambling as "morally outdated" Wednesday, warning that the move would cost jobs and billions of dollars in lost revenue.

The Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling, led by Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire casino owner, is pushing legislation that would make it illegal for banks and credit card companies to process transactions with online casinos.

"This is an attempt by one businessman to protect his monopoly and line his pockets at the expense of working families," said Jason Ader, CEO of SpringOwl Asset Management, which owns shares in several Las Vegas casinos.

Ader was joined at a news conference by other casino magnates including Steve Wynn of Wynn Resorts and Michael Gaughan of South Point Casino who warned that the ban would devastate the economy of states like Nevada that have relied on gambling revenue to fund schools and infrastructure projects.

"This is not only bad for our businesses but also for the thousands of people we employ," Wynn said. "It's nothing more than veiled protectionism."

Gaughan said he was puzzled by Adelson's push for the ban since his own casinos offered online gambling. "Sheldon should be happy I'm giving him some competition," he said.

Adelson, who has contributed millions of dollars to conservative candidates and causes, has said he is backing the ban because he doesn't want children to become addicted to gambling.

#  Indian Tribe Goes to War Over Gambling

For years, the St. Regis Mohawk tribe in Upstate New York has been fighting to keep their casino open. The tribe has argued that the casino is an important part of their culture and that it provides jobs and revenue for the community. But the state has insisted that the casino is illegal, and last week, they won a major victory when a federal judge ruled that the casino must close.

The Mohawks say they will fight on, but it's not clear how they can win this battle. The tribe has already lost several court cases, and they don't have much support from the public or from state lawmakers. In fact, many people in the area see the casino as a blight on the community, and they're happy to see it close.

The Mohawks aren't the only tribe facing this kind of struggle. Across the country, tribes are fighting to keep their casinos open, and many of them are losing. In California, for example, a number of tribes have had their casinos shut down in recent months.

There are a number of reasons for this trend. For one thing, courts are increasingly reluctant to rule in favor of tribes who claim that their casinos are protected by tribal sovereignty. And even if a tribe wins a case like that, they often face opposition from local residents who don't want a casino in their community.

Casinos also bring new problems to tribal communities. In addition to creating tension with local residents, they can also lead to increased crime and addiction problems. And while casinos do provide jobs and revenue for tribes, those benefits tend to be short-lived. Once a casino is established, it's often difficult for tribes to get rid of it.

So why do tribes continue to build casinos? One reason is that gambling is an important part of their culture. Many tribes see gambling as a way to preserve their heritage and traditions. And for some tribes, gambling is the only source of income available outside of government assistance programs.

Ultimately, whether or not tribes should be allowed to operate casinos is up for debate. But what is clear is that these battles are going to continue into the future. Tribes will continue to fight for their casinos, and state lawmakers will continue to try to shut them down.

#  Second-Chance Gambling May Lead to More Addictions

Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but for some people it can quickly become an addiction. In fact, gambling addiction is a real problem, and it can lead to financial ruin and even mental health issues.

Fortunately, there is help available for those who are struggling with a gambling addiction. There are many different types of treatment available, including counseling and medication.

For some people, however, treatment may not be enough. They may need to enter a rehab facility in order to overcome their addiction.

There are many different rehab facilities available, and each one offers its own unique set of services and treatments. It can be difficult to decide which rehab facility is right for you or your loved one.

One thing to consider is whether or not the rehab facility offers a second-chance program. A second-chance program is designed for people who have failed to overcome their addiction after receiving treatment from another rehab facility.

Second-chance programs are often more intensive than traditional treatment programs, and they offer a higher success rate. If you or your loved one is struggling with a gambling addiction, then a second-chance program may be the best option.

#  NH Group Works to Repeal Gambling Laws

Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the New Hampshire Legislature announced their intention to repeal the state’s ban on gambling. The group is led by State Rep. Timothy Horrigan (D-Durham) and includes 16 co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle.

Under the proposed repeal, each of New Hampshire’s 10 counties would be able to decide whether to allow gambling within its borders. The bill would also allow for two casinos and one video gaming terminal establishment in the state.

Rep. Horrigan believes that the repeal would help generate much-needed revenue for the state. “This is a bill that will create jobs and provide much needed revenue for our state,” he said in a statement. “It’s time to bring our gambling laws into the 21st century and give Granite Staters the opportunity to benefit from this growing industry.”

The proposed repeal has generated some opposition, including from Gov. Chris Sununu (R). Sununu has said that he does not support gambling and believes it would be harmful to New Hampshire’s economy.

Supporters of the repeal argue that neighboring states like Maine and Massachusetts have already legalized gambling, and that repealing the ban would help keep New Hampshire competitive. They also note that allowing gambling would create jobs and generate revenue for the state.

The proposed repeal will likely face a tough battle in the Legislature, where there is still significant opposition to legalizing gambling. However, with 16 bipartisan sponsors, there may be enough support to at least get the issue debated in committee.

#  Casinos in Las Vegas see Decrease in Profits

Casinos in Las Vegas are seeing a decrease in profits as a result of the legalization of gambling in other states. The New York Times reports that casinos in other states, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, have been able to offer more gambling options at a lower price than casinos in Las Vegas. As a result, casino revenue has decreased by five percent in the past year.

This decrease is especially notable because it comes during a time when the economy is booming. Gambling companies are now looking for new ways to increase revenue, such as by building more hotel rooms and expanding their non-gambling offerings.

Casinos are not the only businesses that have been affected by gambling legalization. Restaurants and bars near casinos have also seen a decrease in business. This is likely because people are choosing to stay on the casino property rather than go into town for dinner or drinks.
