#  Jays Sweep Orioles To Take The Lead In The AL East

The Toronto Blue Jays completed a three game sweep of the Baltimore Orioles over the weekend, vaulting themselves into first place in the AL East. The Jays were led offensively by Kendrys Morales, who hit two home runs on Sunday and now has six homers on the season.

J.A. Happ was excellent in his start on Saturday, allowing just one run in seven innings of work. Bobby Ryan Jersey The bullpen also continued its impressive streak, with Tyler Clippard, Aaron Loup and Roberto Osuna combining to pitch four scoreless innings on Sunday.

With the win, the Blue Jays improved to 21-10 on the season and now have a one-game lead over the Orioles in the AL East. They will look to extend their winning streak when they open a series against the Yankees on Monday night.

#  Edwin Encarnacion's Walk-Off Home Run Lifts Toronto Over Boston

In the bottom of the eleventh inning with two outs, Edwin Encarnacion hit a walk-off home run to lift the Toronto Blue Jays over the Boston Red Sox.

This was Encarnacion's second walk-off home run of the season and it came at a crucial time for the Blue Jays, who are currently in a tight race for first place in the American League East.

The Blue Jays got off to a great start in this game, scoring four runs in the first inning. However, the Red Sox battled back and eventually tied the game late in the ninth inning.

The Blue Jays are now just one game behind the Baltimore Orioles for first place in the AL East.

#  Blue Jays Are Heating Up Just In Time For The Playoffs

The Toronto Blue Jays have been heating up just in time for the playoffs. They currently have a record of 88-69 and are in second place in the American League East.

The Blue Jays have been on a hot streak lately, winning six of their last seven games. Their offence has been clicking, scoring at least six runs in each of those wins.

Justin Smoak has been leading the charge for the Blue Jays offence. He has been on a tear lately, hitting .516 with six home runs and 16 RBI over his last 10 games.

Josh Donaldson has also been playing well lately. He is hitting .333 with four homers and 12 RBI over his last 10 games.

The Blue Jays will need to continue to play well if they want to make it to the playoffs. They are currently two games behind the Boston Red Sox for first place in the AL East.

The Blue Jays will finish the season with series against the Baltimore Orioles and Boston Red Sox.

#  September Surge Has Toronto Inching Closer To Second Wild Card

For the Toronto Blue Jays, the month of September has been a time of resurgence. After stumbling out of the gate to begin the season, the Blue Jays have managed to fight their way back into contention for a playoff spot.

The surge began on September 1st, when the Blue Jays took down the Cleveland Indians 5-2. That game was highlighted by an Edwin Encarnacion home run, as well as strong starts from Marco Estrada and Roberto Osuna.

Since that game, the Blue Jays have continued to play well. They picked up two more wins against Cleveland over the weekend, and followed that up with another win against the Baltimore Orioles on Monday night.

With those three wins, Toronto has inched closer to securing a berth in the second wild card spot. They now sit just 3.5 games back of Minnesota for that spot.

The Blue Jays still have some work to do in order to make it to the playoffs. But with players like Encarnacion and Josh Donaldson performing at a high level, they certainly have a chance.

#  Josh Donaldson Dazzles As Toronto Beats Detroit, Maintains Playoff Hopes

In a game that could potentially knock the Detroit Tigers out of playoff contention, Josh Donaldson propelled the Toronto Blue Jays to a 6-3 victory on Friday night.

Donaldson was electric at the plate and in the field, providing all of Toronto’s offence with two homers and five RBIs. His defence was just as impressive, making a number of highlight-reel plays at third base.

With the win, the Blue Jays maintained their slim playoff hopes and remain just four games back of the Baltimore Orioles for the final wild card spot in the American League.

If they are going to make a late-season run, they will need production from players like Donaldson. The 29-year-old All-Star is having a career year, batting .292 with 33 homers and 95 RBIs.

“He’s been huge for us all year long,” said Blue Jays outfielder Kevin Pillar after the game. “There’s not much more you can say about him. He’s an MVP candidate for sure.”

The Blue Jays will need more big performances from Donaldson in order to make the playoffs, but there is no doubt that he is up for the challenge.
