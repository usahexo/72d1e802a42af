#  FIND OUT IF YOU HAVE THE POKER HAND CONTAINING FOUR OF A KIND!

If you want to know whether you have the poker hand containing four of a kind, then read on! Playing poker can be great fun, but if you're looking to improve your chances of winning, then it's important to understand all the different hands. This guide will teach you how to determine whether or not you have the poker hand containing four of a kind.

The first thing that you need to do is draw five cards from a deck of 52 cards. Once you've done this, you need to identify which set of four cards constitutes a four of a kind. In order to do this, look at the rank of the card and then find all other cards with the same rank. If there are no other cards with that rank, then it doesn't count as a four of a kind.

For example, if you draw an Ace, two Kings and two Queens from the deck, then the Ace, King and Queen are all part of one four of a kind. However, if you were to draw an Ace, two Jacks and two Kings from the deck instead, then there would be two different sets of four of a kind (Aces and Jacks as well as Kings and Queens).

Once you've identified which set of four cards constitutes a four of a kind, simply compare your hand against the list below in order to see if you have won!

A♣️K♠️Q♣️J♦ - Yes! This is a royal flush and therefore beats any other hand.

2♥️3♠️4♦️5♥ - No! This is not a four of a kind.

A♦️K♥️Q♦️J♣ - Yes! This is a full house and therefore beats any other three-of-a-kind hand.

2♣️3♦️4♥️5♠ - No! This is not a four of a kind.
